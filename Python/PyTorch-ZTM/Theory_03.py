# # CNN
# 
# A type artifical neural network, it has convolutional and non covolutional layers
# 
# There are many filters in the convolutional layers and they have specific tasks of detecting certain parts of the image for example textures, edges, etc...
# 
# Essentially there is filter where it goes over the image this is the kernal size then it produces a product of the output and this happens over and over again, the weights and bias of the filter is what is changed overtime

# # Max Pool
# 
# Reduces the no. of pixels
# 
# We give a filter size, the stride is how many pixels the filter moves
# 
# From every filter uses it takes the highest one  
# 
# Its helful becz it reduces parameters() and computational needs and reduce over fitting, this is due to a sort of generalisation
