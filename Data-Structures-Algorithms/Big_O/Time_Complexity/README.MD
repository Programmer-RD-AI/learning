# Time Complexity

## Rules
- Worst Case
  - We think of the worst case scenario when calculating the Big O notation
- Remove Constants
  - O(1+n/2+100) -> O(n)
- Different terms for Inputs
  - there can be different terms for different inputs, so if its nested then its * and if not then its addition
- Drop Non Dominants
  - We get the biggest variable ex O(n+n^2) -> O(n^2) becz n is smaller

## O(n!)
- Factorial: Denoted by the exclamation mark (!). Factorial means to multiply by decreasing positive integers. For example, 5! = 5 ∗ 4 ∗ 3 ∗ 2 ∗ 1 = 120.
