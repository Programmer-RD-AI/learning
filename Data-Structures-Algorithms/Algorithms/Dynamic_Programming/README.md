# Introduction

It is an optimization technique
Do you have something you can cache? Dynamic Programming
Its just a buzz word at the end of the day
Breaking a big problem into small problems and solving them to make sure that they are stored so if the same problem comes up.

# Caching

Caching is a way to store values so we can use em later on. Think of it as a backpack. Instead of going back home to when you need something you can just get them quickly.

## Memoization

Memoization is a special form of caching, because we use it a lot in dynamic programming.
This is where we cache the return value of a function based on its parameters, and if the parameters don't change then its memoized and it will always return the same value from the cache.

# If a problem can use dynamic programming..?

1. Can be divided into subproblem
2. Recursion solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblem?
4. Memoize subproblem

# Review

One other way which is called bottom up approach because we start from the simplest solution to the biggest problem.
