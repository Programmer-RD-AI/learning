# Introduction

Recursion isn't technically an algorithm, but more of an concept that is used within algorithms (and a lot!)
One of the most popular topics in interviews
Recursion is when a function calls itself

# Stack Overflow

When an recursive function calls it self until a point is reached where the stack size has exceeded

# Anatomy of Recursion

Every recursive function needs a base case, where the recursion function stops and finally return a value when a certain condition is met

# Recursive vs Iterative

Anything you do with recursion **CAN** be done iteratively (loop)

Recursion: Dry Readability (Pro), Large Stack so More memory (Con)

## When to use Recursion

Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree consider recursion.

1. Dived into a number of subproblem that are smaller instances of the same problem
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
3. The solution of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand
