# Introduction

This sorting algorithm can get done with O(n log n), space complexity: O(n)
They use the technique described as divide and conquer, when opening a phone book we break up the pages until we find the phone number.
Also uses the concept of recursion.
Divide the list into 2 lists then we are going to divide those ones into half again until we have 1 item. We are going to take the first and second item and then put the smallest one first
Extremely efficient
