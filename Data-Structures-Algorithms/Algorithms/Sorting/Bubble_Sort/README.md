Part of the elementary sorts. In bubble sort when we get a list and we need to sort it what we do is:
We check the first and second element of the list and if they are 2nd one is bigger than we swap until the end of the list.
Then we go again from the beginning of the list until there is a sorted list.
Its not the most efficient:
Time Complexity : O(n^2) time complexity
Space Complexity : O(1) space complexity
