# Static vs Dynamic

- Static arrays has a constant no. of values where dynamic arrays no. of values can be changed
- In some languages all of the arrays are dynamically, so we need to not consider about memory, so optimization problems
- When we meed to add another element since this array is dynamic it will be deleted and recreated essentially.
