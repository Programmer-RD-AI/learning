# Theory

Idempotent - Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in abstract algebra and functional programming.

Collisions - Collisions in the HashMap. A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.

insert - O(1)
lookup - O(1)
delete - O(1)
search - O(1)
Worse case scenario: O(n/k) -> O(n)

# Arrays vs Hash Tables

O(1) for Everything in Hash Tables but O(n) occurs in arrays.
Hash tables are used in data bases due to low latency...

# Review

- Fast Lookups
- Fast Inserts
- Flexible Keys
- Unordered
- Slow key iteration
