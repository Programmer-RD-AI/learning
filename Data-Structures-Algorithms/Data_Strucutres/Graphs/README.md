# Introduction

Most useful and used data structures in CS when it comes to modelling real life

Set of values that are related in a pair way

Each item is called a: Node (Vertex)

Nodes are connected with Edge's

Great to represent real world relationships

Used to represent Networks as well.

# Types of Graphs

## Characteristics

<!-- Traffic Flow Type things -->

Directed - One in one direction or both directions but it is limited

- A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction

Undirected - Can you back and forth between nodes are they wish

- An undirected graph comprises a set of nodes and links connecting them

## Weighted Graphs

Values can be added to different aspects such as the edge.
Used in google maps type thing, for example fastest way to get from 1 node to another
Unweighted - No values in edges
Weighted - Values in Edges

- A weighted graph is a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight.

## Vertices Graphs

Cyclic - Where we nodes are interconnected and we can go from 1 node and back to that same node, a circular graph
Acyclic - Where we cant go from 1 node back to the same node

# Review

Pros -> Relationships
Cons - Scaling is hard
