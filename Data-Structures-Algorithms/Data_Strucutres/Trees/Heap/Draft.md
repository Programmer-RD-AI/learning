## Binary Heap

lookup is O(n)
Less ordered than binary tree
The factor that the element right is higher than the root and the other way around is not applied here..., and values are added kinda rdmly...

## Priority Queue

Parent is always bigger than the children
Priotirty Queue is where the order doesnt matter but the element with the highest priority is serverd first

## Pros and Cons

Better than O(n)
Priority
Flexible Size
Fast Insert

Slow lookup
