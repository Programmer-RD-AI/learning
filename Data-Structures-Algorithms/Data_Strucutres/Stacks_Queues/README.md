# Stacks & Queues

## Introduction

Linear Data Structure
Allows us to go through data elements one by one (sequentially) where only 1 element can be reached
Only different is how the day is removed

## Stacks

Typa data structue like plates, the plates get stacked ontop of each other vertifically, and we can only access the top plate
LIFO - Last in first out
.pop() -> O(1) -> Remove the top of the stack
.push() -> O(1) -> Add to the top of the stack
.peek() -> O(1) -> Top of the stack
.lookup() -> O(n) -> Go through the stack

## Queues

Its like being in an queue, and it FIFO, first in first out
Used in programming problems and interview problems
Ticket management or a printer.!
.lookup() -> O(n) -> Go through the queue
.enqueue() -> O(1) -> Add to the end of the queue
.dequeue() -> O(1) -> Remove the first in the queue
.peek() -> O(1) -> First item in the queue
