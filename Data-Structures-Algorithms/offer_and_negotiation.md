# Handling Rejection

It doesn't mean anything, because no body care about the rejection, It doesn't appear anywhere it just disappears after the rejection. Being rejected doesn't mean you are a bad coder or a developer, its just that you dent fit the company or haven gotten the companies you will go to without that rejection. Its all a statistics game, it doesn't matter how many companies reject you, you must get back up and try and get more interviews and in one you will get accepted at the end. Whenever you get rejected always ask the interviewer or the contact about why you got rejected in turn helping you become a better developer in general, and ask when you can reapply latter on.

# Handling an Offer

- Don't end the conversation
- Keep the conversation going, and let them know you are interviewing other companies, but tell you want to work there but that you want to make the correct decision with the other offers
- Don't seem greedy
- The first thing we do when we get an offer is to as for more time
- Let other companies you are applying to know that you got an offer, build a sense of urgency so that the companies will respond, classic psychological trick.
  - Email: Hello, [Person or Company], I just wanted to let you know and give you an update on my interviewing process. I've just received an offer from the [company]. With that said, i am really excited to potentially be working with your company. I had a really good time interviewing with you and I really wanted to see if we can make things work. Since my timeline is a now little bit compress with this new offer.. Is there any way for the things to go a little bit faster?
- When you decline an offer be polite to them

## TODO

- Find exact salary you want
- What value do you provide?
- Go higher
  - Meet in the middle at the end

# Handling Multiple Offers

1. Is there ean offer that you feel you are under qualified for?
   - If yes, then accept that offer, because we want to grow in the job
2. Long term growth potential
   - Which offer allows you to grow? Not only as a programmer but also in term of the company
3. Will you respect people around you?
4. Salary and benefits?
5. Is your decision based on desperation?

# Getting a Raise

Its usually not that hard, if someone hired you they find you valuable. To get a raise you have to be a great employee. Hit the ground running, before you start a job plan out a career path, so you can make sure you grow in your company as for your career path.

1. Ask for a raise
   - You'll get a raise if you provide value to the company
   - They rather keep current employees
2. Show. Don't tell
   - You have to show them why you are valuable, make a presentation maybe a one page summary or document and send them to the manager or someone which shows why you matter to the company.
   - Keep track of the stuff you have done for the company such as problems you have solved, comments from other people, skill levels
